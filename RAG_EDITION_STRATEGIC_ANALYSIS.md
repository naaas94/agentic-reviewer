- No access to policy guidelines, historical decisions, or annotated examples
- Potential for hallucinations due to lack of factual grounding

#### **Limited Explainability**
- Explanations based only on LLM reasoning, not external evidence
- No citation of regulatory frameworks or policy documents
- Reduced stakeholder confidence in audit decisions

#### **Regulatory Compliance Gaps**
- No direct integration with legal frameworks
- Limited alignment with specific compliance requirements
- Reduced auditability for regulatory purposes

## Proposed RAG Edition Architecture

### System Overview

The Agentic Reviewer RAG Edition enhances the original semantic auditor by integrating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. This extension enables the reviewer to incorporate external knowledge (e.g., policy guidelines, annotated logs, historical predictions) into its reasoning pipeline, resulting in more grounded, context-aware evaluations.

Rather than solely relying on the LLM's latent knowledge, the system queries a vector store to retrieve semantically similar reference documents and injects them into the agent's prompt. This approach reduces hallucinations, improves consistency, and enables deeper regulatory alignment.

### Core Architecture

The system extends the unified agent with a pre-processing retrieval layer that fetches relevant documents prior to LLM invocation. This allows the agent to reason over retrieved factual context when evaluating predictions.
